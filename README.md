**Snoring Recognition Project**

You can learn how to classify SnoringAudio with custom deeplearning model by processing this project.<br/>
The following is a description depending on the version.</br>
You can compare with these versions.

|Version|Data|Explain|
|:------|---:|---:|
|v1|audio (1D)|Trained Raw wave of .wav data without fine-tuning|
|v2|audio (1D)|Trained Raw wave of .wav data with fine-tuning|
|v3|mfcc (2D)|Trained MFCC data using StandardScaler(0 ~ 1) regularization technique|
|v4|mfcc (2D)|Trained MFCC data using custom MinMaxScaler(0 ~ 255) regularization technique|
